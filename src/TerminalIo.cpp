/* Line buffer handling to linearize output from overlapped command execution
 *
 * This solves the issue of having multiple programs (compilers and such)
 * writing output to both stdout and stderr at the same time. Normally on UNIX
 * the terminal will arbitrate amongst them in a decent fashion, but it really
 * screws up long error messages that span several lines. On Win32, commands
 * will happily write all over each other and there's no help from the
 * operating system console so a custom solution must be devised.
 *
 * The solution implemented here works as follows:
 *
 * - We assign the TTY to one job thread which is allowed to echo its child
 *   process text directly. The job id of the current TTY owner is stored in
 *   `s_PrintingJobIndex'.
 *
 * - exec_unix.c: We create pipes for stdout and stderr for all spawned child processes. We
 *   loop around these fds using select() until they both return EOF.
 *
 * - exec_unix.c: Whenever select() returns we try to read up to kLineBufSize bytes. If
 *   there isn't anything to read, the fd is closed. The select loop will exit
 *   only when both stdout and stderr have been closed.
 *
 * - The data read from child FDs is either
 *   a) Directly emitted to the build tool's stdout/stderr if the job owns the
 *      TTY (or can become the owner).
 *   b) Buffered, in which case it will be output later.
 *
 * - If all buffers are occupied we will block the thread until one is ready.
 *   This of course wastes time, but this typically only happens when there is
 *   lots and lots of error message output (interactive builds) so it isn't as
 *   bad as it sounds.
 *
 * - When jobs finish they will wait for TTY ownership and flush their queued
 *   messages. This is to avoid the TTY drifting too far off from what's
 *   actually being executed.
 *
 * For the outside observer this will produce log output with all the output
 * for each job together in a nice and linear fashion. For the case when
 * thread-count is 1, it will naturally copy text right out to stdout/stderr
 * without any buffering.
