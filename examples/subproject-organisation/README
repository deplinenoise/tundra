This example demonstrate how to have libs with their own examples and/or
unit-tests which are compilable directly in their root folder or only the 
library as part of a bigger project. the idea is to have the libraries as 
subprojects included into the main-app (also revision-control wise).

you can compile this example in this main-folder (and get the main-app)
or you can start tundra in extlibs/libA and get the library-example-app.
